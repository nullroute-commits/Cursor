## System Architecture Overview

The application is built using Django 5 with a sophisticated multi-service architecture including:

- **Django 5.0.2 Web Application** with Python 3.12.5
- **PostgreSQL 17.2** database with optimized configuration
- **SQLAlchemy 1.4.49** for advanced ORM capabilities
- **Memcached 1.6.22** for high-performance caching
- **RabbitMQ 3.12.8** for message queuing and async processing
- **Nginx 1.24** for load balancing and static file serving
- **RBAC System** for fine-grained access control
- **Audit Logging** for comprehensive activity tracking

## Production Infrastructure

### Services Deployed

The production environment consists of the following containerized services:

1. **Web Application** - Django application with Gunicorn WSGI server
2. **Database** - PostgreSQL with performance optimizations
3. **Cache** - Memcached for session and query caching
4. **Message Queue** - RabbitMQ with management interface
5. **Load Balancer** - Nginx for reverse proxy and static files
6. **Monitoring** - Prometheus for metrics collection
7. **Logging** - Fluentd for log aggregation

### Container Configuration

- **Scaling**: 2 web application replicas for high availability
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints for optimal performance
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive monitoring for all services
- **Persistence**: Data volumes for PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ
- **Security**: Non-root users and secure configurations

## Application Interfaces

### Django Web Application

The main Django application provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system
- Audit logging for all user activities
- RESTful API endpoints
- Admin interface for system management

### Admin Interface

The Django admin interface offers:
- User and group management
- Permission configuration
- System monitoring
- Audit log review
- Database administration

## Monitoring and Management

### RabbitMQ Management Interface

**URL**: http://localhost:15672
**Credentials**: prod_user / secure-rabbitmq-password-123

The RabbitMQ management interface provides:
- Queue monitoring and management
- Message flow statistics
- Connection and channel monitoring
- Performance metrics
- User and virtual host management

### Prometheus Metrics

**URL**: http://localhost:9090

Prometheus collects and stores:
- Application performance metrics
- Infrastructure monitoring data
- Custom business metrics
- Alert rules and notifications

## Security Features

### Security Implementations

- **HTTPS/TLS Support**: SSL certificates for encrypted communication
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **XSS Prevention**: Cross-site scripting protection
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and ORM protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling to prevent abuse
- **Session Security**: Secure session management
