## üö® Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Multi-arch builds**: Platform engineering team backup plan
2. **Registry integration**: Multiple registry support options
3. **Security scanning**: Fallback to alternative tools if needed
4. **Alpine compatibility**: Ubuntu fallback images prepared

### Contingency Plans:
- **Day 3**: If multi-arch builds fail, focus on single-arch first
- **Day 5**: If security scanning fails, implement basic CVE checking
- **Day 8**: If quality gates fail, implement basic linting only
