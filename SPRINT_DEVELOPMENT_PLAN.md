- [ ] Expose optional /api/pq-handshake when POST_QUANTUM=1
- [ ] Run bandit & safety scans in local CI
- [ ] Add docs for HTTPS and auth usage

### ✅ **Definition of Done**
**Authenticated routes require JWT, HTTPS reachable locally, optional PQ handshake works, security scans report no critical issues**

### 🚀 **Implementation Plan**
1. **Week 1**: Authentication implementation and JWT setup
2. **Week 2**: HTTPS configuration, security scanning, and documentation

---

## 🔄 **Continuous Improvement**

### 📋 **Practices**
- [ ] Backlog grooming each Friday
- [ ] Sprint retrospectives focusing on PQ flag integration
- [ ] Track Docker image size diff (normal vs PQ)

### 📊 **Metrics**
- [ ] Image size delta
- [ ] Test coverage
- [ ] Lint error count

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### 🐳 **Docker Configuration**
```dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile with POST_QUANTUM support
FROM python:3.11-alpine

ARG POST_QUANTUM=false
ENV POST_QUANTUM=$POST_QUANTUM

# Conditional package installation
RUN if [ "$POST_QUANTUM" = "true" ]; then \
        pip install pqcrypto; \
    fi

# Rest of Dockerfile...
```

### 🔧 **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# .env file with feature flags
POST_QUANTUM=false
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
HTTPS_ENABLED=true
```

### 🧪 **Testing Strategy**
```bash
# Matrix testing for different configurations
make test-post-quantum
make test-classic
make test-security
make test-ui
```
